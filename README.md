Martian Agora
========
A Mars colonization simulator that uses real colonization strategies and real Mars data. Built with Unity3D, Blender, Gimp, and Audacity.

# A Note About Code Quality
Martian Agora is one of my earliest Unity3D projects. Over the years the code has mutated hideously for the sake of teaching or presentations. So please note that if you're looking for a higher quality software project, consider looking at my other projects like Coulombic.

# Features

### Drive
A drivable Mars rover. Look at it and press 'E' to enter. Press 'M' to change the camera view. WASD steers. Space is brakes.

### Build
Structures like turbines, atmospheric water generators, solar panels, batteries, water tanks, etc. Press 'I' to access the inventory. From there, select a building. Then you need to equip the 'virtual reality visor'. By default, you do this by pressing '3', because it's the third item in your inventory slot. When a blue building blueprint pops up, left click to place it. Then fill its nodes with the required materials, and hold click on task nodes (cones) with the proper tools to construct the building.

### Resources
Press 'C' to view your resources and building statuses. Produce, store, and consume resources.

### Inventory
Inventory system with tools and materials for building. Press 'I' to access it. Click and drag to move them around. You can place tools in the bottom slots. Then press 0 through 9 on the keyboard to equip it.

# Future
Contact me if you're interested in collaboration. Even if you have no programming experience, I would love to take what I've learned here to collaborate on the design of Martian Agora 2. I am far better at 3D games programming now.
